# Python Programming Assignments

This repository contains my Python programming assignment solutions.  
Each assignment folder includes multiple task files (e.g., `task1.py`, `task2.py`, etc.) that solve different problems.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the assignment folder you want to test.
2. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
